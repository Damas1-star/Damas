            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>ProTech academy Rwanda was developed by HAFASHIMANA JEAN DAMASCENE. He is young Rwandan who is striving to help many people to gain, and use knowledge and skills on digital world. Actual Jean Damascene is a teacher in Southern province, Huye district in that region which is developing quickly they need to insert ICT and artificial intelligent in their daily activities.

            <p>With technology advancing rapidly, it’s crucial to empower individuals with ICT skills to remain competitive in the workforce or improve their business operations. Offering ICT training services is a way to help the youth and business owners build valuable skills that align with modern job markets, foster entrepreneurship, and support economic growth. This also contributes to Rwanda’s vision of becoming a knowledge-based economy.</p>

            <p>The world is increasingly driven by data and automation, and coding and AI are key skills for the future. Training young Rwandans in these areas provides them with the tools to participate in the global tech economy and encourages innovation. This initiative aims to reduce skills gaps in high-demand fields, foster local innovation, and potentially position Rwanda as a regional tech hub.</p>

            <p>As technology becomes increasingly integral to daily life and business, people need technical support in installing and configuring devices and applications. This service meets the demand for smooth technology adoption, particularly for people who may not be tech-savvy. 
                It helps businesses and individuals ensure their devices and software are correctly set up for optimal use.
                 The shift toward e-governance and digital services is a key trend in Rwanda and many other countries. 
                Creating an online service platform similar to Irembo (which provides access to public services) and RRA (Revenue Authority services) helps improve government efficiency, transparency, and access to essential services. The aim is to bridge the gap between citizens and government by simplifying procedures and making services more accessible.</p>
